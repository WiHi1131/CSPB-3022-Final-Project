Project Topic: What Best Predicts Ski Resort Ticket Prices?
Skiing is an essential pastime to many Colorado natives such as myself. However, the ability to ski or ride the slopes is extremely cost-prohibitive, and lift ticket prices continue to rise year by year. Various ski resorts appear to share many similar features to the casual skier, yet some resort ticket prices are much higher than others. Are there clear reasons for why some resorts are priced through the roof, or are some ski resort owners overpricing their lift tickets and not offering more/better features for what skiers are paying?

In this project, I will attempt to build the best regression model possible to predict adult lift ticket prices for ski resorts. I will try to predict adult ticket prices based on different objective and subjective features of these ski resorts. Examples of objective features might be total size or total area available for freeriding (in kilometers), while examples of subjective features might be ratings of overall cleanliness or accomodations, out of five. Using combinations and/or amalgamations of predictors like those mentioned above, I will attempt to find the best predictor of adult lift ticket prices (at least for resorts in the USA, and possible other countries), and then conclude whether or not the resorts with the best feature or combinations of features are charging more for lift tickets.
